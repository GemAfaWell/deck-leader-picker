# 100Devs Project: Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Leader Picker!  
## Choose your Leader!  
 
I thought I'd take it back to the childhood with one of my first favorite anime cartoons - the original Yu-Gi-Oh! Styled with the heart of the cards in mind, this deck leader picker is sure to throw some folks right back to 1996, where the magic first started in Japan with the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game!
